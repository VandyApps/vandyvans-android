Vandy Vans
==========

Vandy Vans is an open-source Android project created by [Vanderbilt University](http://vanderbilt.edu) students through a student organization called [VandyApps](https://www.facebook.com/VandyMobile).

The purpose of the app is to provide a fast, native way for Vanderbilt students to access the van schedule as well as a live map of the vans' locations on their Android phones.

## Importing Project Using IntelliJ IDEA

When importing the project into IntelliJ, navigate to PROJECT_HOME/GuideAndroid/, click on
pom.xml in the folder and click `import`. IDEA will setup all our dependencies automatically as specified in the 
pom.xml so that you don't have to worry about doing library project import, which is really really really HARD.
